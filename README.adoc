== location of log

This is a very simple, but practical library for logging in applications. Its
main feature is printing source code locations to make debugging easier.

to use:

[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"lol.mleku.dev"
)

func main() {
	err := errorf.E("this is a pretend error")
	if chk.E(err) {
		log.E.F("you saw it print the error creating it, checking it, and now here is a log")
	}
}
----

There are more variants, different error levels, a level setting that can be
changed while running. See the handy shortcut packages in chk, errorf and log
for more details.
